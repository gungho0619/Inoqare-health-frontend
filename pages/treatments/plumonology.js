            Primary pneumothorax is pneumothorax that occurs spontaneously, that
            is, without a triggering factor, in an overall healthy lung. It is a
            condition that mostly affects young people, more often men than
            women.
            <br />
            The cause is often the spontaneous rupture of a small peripheral
            apical bubble. These bubbles are most often located at the apex
            (top) of the lung. Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs more often in
            smokers than in non-smokers. <br />
            This causes a very variable symptomatology ranging from a feeling of
            chest discomfort, through pain, to dyspnea (shortness of breath).
            The pneumothorax can be small, that is, only the top of the lung is
            detached from the wall, as it can be complete, meaning that the lung
            is completely collapsed (deflated).

            The initial treatment depends on the severity of the pneumothorax.
            When it is not very important, it is enough to make sure of its
            spontaneous and complete resolution which occurs in a few days, even
            one or two weeks. If it is more important, a drain will be placed in
            the pleural space, which can be done under local anesthesia at the
            patient’s bed. Most of the time, this action fixes the problem in a
            few days.
            <br />
            When a pneumothorax has occurred for the first time, there is about
            a one in five chance of recurrence. In a second episode (first
            recurrence), the risk of recurrence is about one in two. The risk is
            about four in five during the third episode (second recurrence).
            Therefore, surgical treatment is generally offered during the second
            episode (first recurrence). The operation, which is a pleurectomy,
            is relatively simple and consists of resecting the responsible
            bubble and making a gesture that “sticks” the lung to the wall – in
            general, the pleura is mechanically irritated by simple abrasion.
            This operation is most often done by thoracoscopy. The postoperative
            hospital stay is generally 2 to 3 days.
            <br />
            The cases where surgical treatment is offered during a first episode
            of pneumothorax are those where the drain does not allow the
            pneumothorax to be overcome after a few days and those where the
            occurrence of pneumothorax represents a particular danger for the
            patient. patient (aviation personnel and professional divers in
            particular). Indeed, if with each breath there is always a little
            more air which enters the pleural cavity and which it cannot leave,
            it gradually forms a pneumothorax under tension which compresses and
            deforms the large venous structures. inside the chest, preventing
            blood from returning to the heart. There is then a danger to the
            patient’s life if the pneumothorax is not drained immediately.

            Secondary pneumothorax has an identifiable cause.
            <br />
            It can be a disease or injury of the lung such as severe emphysema,
            lymphangioleiomyomatosis (a congenital disease affecting women which
            causes lung cysts to form) or a lung tumor.
            <br /> However, trauma is the most common cause of secondary
            pneumothorax.
            <br />
            Finally, it sometimes happens that it is the doctor who injures the
            lung during a therapeutic puncture (installation of a central venous
            route, that is to say the installation of a catheter in a large vein
            at the base of the neck) or diagnostic (puncture of a pleural
            effusion for example). <br />
            Treatment
            <br />
            Treatment for secondary pneumothorax can be simple observation in a
            hospital setting if it is not important, placement of a pleural
            drain, or sometimes surgery.

            Lung cancer
            <br />
            Lung cancer is the presence of one or more tumors in the lungs. It
            is often called lung cancer because its origin is usually located in
            the bronchial lining (the layer that lines the inside of the
            bronchi).

            His diagnosis is often late because there is no really significant
            warning sign. Depending on the case and the stage of the disease,
            different treatments may be offered in isolation or in combination
            (surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, radiotherapy).
            <br />
            Surgical procedures are Tumorectomy (removal of a tumor), Lobectomy
            (removal of one lobe of the lung), Bi lobectomy (removal of two
            lobes of the lung), or Pneumonectomy (removal of an entire lung).

          <p>
            The mediastinum is located in the center of the rib cage. Different
            types of tumors can originate from the mediastinum. The thymus is
            the organ most often affected. This participates in the production
            of immune defenses. Most of the time, the types of cancer that
            affect it are not aggressive and can be cured.
            <br />
            To treat these tumors, the thymus gland containing the tumor is
            removed during surgery. If the cancer is of an aggressive type, it
            is necessary to add chemotherapy and radiation therapy. All

            Tracheal tumors depend on the nature of the tumor. Chemotherapy or
            radiation therapy, sometimes the only surgery, may be needed or
            endoscopic laser treatment. Sometimes you have to combine two or
            three treatments. In some cases, a stent is required to keep the

          <p>
            When the membrane around the lungs has cancer, it is most often a
            tumor from another organ (a metastasis). However, cancer sometimes
            starts on the pleura itself. In this case, it most often results
            from exposure to asbestos. Smoking greatly increases the risk of
            developing this form of the disease.
            <br />
            When the disease comes from another organ, care is decided based on
            the nature of the cancer causing it. If the disease is too advanced,
            the only useful treatment is to stick the lungs to the chest wall.
            In the case of a disease caused by asbestos, it is only possible to
            operate on tumors if they are not very developed; the patient must
            also be in good general condition.
