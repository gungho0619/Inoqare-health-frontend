            The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and lasts
            between 1h30 and 3 hours.
            <br />
            This surgical technique consists of:
            <br />
            Remove part of the stomach to reduce its size to a small gastric
            pouch. This pocket thus limits the amount of food consumed.
            <br />
            Modifying the food circuit: part of the intestine is bypassed. Food
            no longer goes to the upper part of the small intestine but directly
            to its middle part. This results in decreased absorption of
            nutrients. There are 2 types of bypass which differ in their
            production technique: the Roux en y bypass and the omega bypass.

            The expected effectiveness is 40-60% excess weight loss. Excess
            weight is a theoretical calculation of excess weight, it serves only
            as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the procedure. The
            calculation method is: example of a patient measuring 1m65, the
            “theoretical ideal” weight is 65 kilos. If his weight is 110
            kilograms, the excess weight is 110-65 = 45 kilograms.
            <br /> Being overweight is not the goal for the patient as the
            weight lost after this procedure may be more or less than the
            expected effectiveness.
